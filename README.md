> **A strategic, high-voltage twist on the classic mine-clearing genre.**

## 🎮 About The Game

**Neon Mines** is not just a test of logic—it's a test of nerves set against a pulsing, retro-futuristic soundscape. We've taken the core mechanics of classic grid-based puzzle games and injected them with vibrant neon aesthetics, dynamic lighting effects, and a modern UI.

Whether you are a casual player looking for a quick visual treat or a hardcore strategist aiming for the leaderboards, Neon Mines offers a glowing experience that stands out in the dark.

### ✨ Key Features

* **Vibrant Aesthetic:** A fully dark-mode optimized interface with glowing neon tiles and particle effects.
* **Dynamic Gameplay:** Fluid animations and responsive controls make every move feel impactful.
* **Multiple Difficulty Modes:** From "Spark" (Easy) to "Overload" (Hardcore).
* **Timer & Scoring System:** Race against the clock to beat your personal best.
* **Custom Sound Design:** [Optional: Mention if you have sound effects/music] immersive synth-wave sound effects.
